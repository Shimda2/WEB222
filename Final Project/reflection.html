        <h2>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?</h2>
        <p id = paragraph> Responsive Web Design (RWD) refers to a an approach of web design which considers optimization based on device screen. A well made web application should be designed in a way such that the contents responsively displaying based on various device screens (e.g. smartphones, tablet, computer and laptop). This includes, resizing contents (e.g. image and text),  adjusting layout and grids and changing color according to the device's screen width and compatibility.</p>
        <h2>How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h2>
        <p id = paragraph> Responsive Web Design is related to web technologies as web applications are being displayed on various type of screens, such as smartphones, tablet and computer monitors. RWD is an essential key to success in achieving high user experience (UX) as it serves to display the web application in its highest quality from any devices. Web technology specifically involves Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for RWD approach. CSS provides normalized property settings accross the application.</p>
        <h2>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?</h2>
        <p id = paragraph> The size of screens may vary in wide range due to variability of devices. Smartphones may be one of the smallest but most commonly used devices for users to access any web applications. It is essential for web applications to adapt its contents based on the size of the screen. Smaller screens such as smartphones require more intuitive CSS design as it is important to display the contents efficiently as well as condensely in limited space. This is the reason why web designers take the "smartphone first" approach when designing an web application. Web applications are designed first with smartphone-target, and expanded to adapt to wider screens</p>
        <h2>Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.</h2>
        <p id = paragraph> Throughout this course, I have learned from fundamental Javascript to web application design. This course has been very resourceful in practicing not only coding skills, but also developing researching skills. I strongly believe that what I have learned from this course would turn into a great value of asset for career development. </p>
